# Example1

This simple project is a very basic project, which is a basic packaging of the hello world program for scala.

Use this example as a way of making sure your environment is all working nicely.

# Things to note

- The source tree folder ([src](./src)). Its' the same layout as a maven folder. Compiled assets being placed in the  [target](./target) folder.
- The [test code](./src/test/scala/HelloWorldTest.scala) is using the [FeatureSpec](http://www.scalatest.org/getting_started_with_feature_spec) so that it reads well. Not quite BDD but getting there.
- It uses [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) to build and test the code.
